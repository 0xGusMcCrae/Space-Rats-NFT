We want to have a Genesis drop of 2000 space rat pfp nfts. 
1000 public and 1000 whitelisted. Then we want to be able to 
send your rats to work in the asteroid mines. While they're 
in the mines they earn Iridum tokens and Geodes. They can crack 
open the Geodes and earn rewards like tradable whitelist spots, 
more Iridium or even spaceship keys. We're just starting to work
on the spaceship art so that will be further down the line but 
we're thinking about having the type of spaceship affect how 
fast they mine.
